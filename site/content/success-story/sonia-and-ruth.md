Do you remember the mother and daughter team of Sonia Cordoba and Ruth Juarez, owners of Soda Vanessa and Cabinas Dilan They offer delicious typical Costa Rican dishes at their restaurant and reasonable rates at their hotel which are located in central Nosara, Costa Rica beside and across from the Catholic Church. We are very proud of both of our @Viveelsueno Intensive Business Training graduates and are impressed with the new additions they have created.

After running Soda Vanessa for 25 years and a smaller version of Cabinas Dilan for 12 years with much success, they participated in the @Viveelsueno programs and then decided to increase their capacity and built a whole new section of their hotel and they now have 21 rooms! The key to their success has been perseverance and reinvesting the little gains they made back into their business. They found that @Viveelsueno taught them about marketing and promotion and helped them to better their customer service techniques. They also became more publicized and better known through the Vive el Sueno marketing and media.

Sonia's advice to other business owners or future entrepreneurs is that " to achieve something in life you have to have a lot of perseverance and desire to work hard."

Contact Ruth and Sonia today at Soda Vanessa and Cabinas Dilan at 2682-0371 or 88634841 for more information and to make your reservation. Support your local business community and help them to live their dreams!
